<h2 style= "color:white;"=>This website you are on right now... was made entirely by code. From the colors of the Font and Background, to the font size and name, everything you
  see here was used by a Code Editor.
  Drawings Over the Years is something I've wanted to do since I was a little kid. My name is Julian, I'm 15 years old and started programming for the following reasons:
1. Programming is a skill that people need to learn. It's functions (if you know how to use em) can be powerful in any way you can imagine.
I'm attending a Program: "TheCoderSchool" Future Updates: Drawings will maximize when clicked. For now just Open in New Tab. My Gmail: legomonkeycuber@gmail.com
